                    We met in 2010 while both working at the Rosedale Apple Store. 
                    Josh worked back-of-house, and Rachel worked at the Genius Bar. 
                    Josh found reasons to spend time in the repair room and talk to Rachel about movies and video games.
                    We chatted on Facebook while we were at Thanksgiving dinners...and then Josh asked Rachel to dinner at The Red Stag in northeast Minneapolis and a movie.
                    Because we are both shy around new people, neither of us was sure if we were going on a date or hanging out as friends (spoiler: it was a date),
                    but it soon became clear we "like"-liked each other.
                        Fast forward a year, we were living together and took a big leap and moved out to Seattle, where things are a bit
                    more temperate, and tech jobs are in high-demand. Eight years later, we love Seattle (so much we bought a house together there), both work in software, and
                    decided it was finally time to tie the knot. Josh, being the romantic in the relationship, proposed while hiking at Mt. Rainier at
                    Mt. Fremont fire lookout, one of our favorite hikes.
                        Because of our love of nature and adventure, we decided to get married in Iceland just outside of Borgarnes (2 hours north of Reykjavik)
                    during the summer, when the sun just barely sets, staying light all the way until after midnight. 
                    To celebrate our nuptials, we're throwing a reception party to celebrate with our friends and family in Minneapolis at
                    Surly Brewery (see details below).
